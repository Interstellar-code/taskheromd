## üéØ Vision & Mission

### Vision Statement
To be the leading subscription management platform that empowers users to take control of their digital spending, never miss a renewal, and optimize their subscription budget.

### Mission Statement
To provide a comprehensive, user-friendly platform that helps individuals and businesses track, manage, and optimize their subscription expenses through intuitive tools, timely reminders, and actionable insights.

## üìä Requirements & Goals
SubsHero is a subscription management platform designed to help users track and manage their subscriptions in one place. The primary goal is to develop SubsHero v2, which maintains all functionality from v1 while introducing new features and improvements.

### Core Requirements:

  - CSV import/export functionality
- **Performance**:
  - Server-side pagination for large datasets
  - Optimized API calls with request deduplication and client-side caching
  - Reduced bundle size through code splitting
  - Improved loading states and error handling

## üìê Project Scope & Boundaries
SubsHero is a subscription management platform, not a payment processor. The application tracks subscriptions and sends reminders but does not process payments directly. Users manually record their subscription payments for tracking purposes.

### In Scope:
- **Core Functionality**:
  - User dashboard for subscription management
  - Admin panel for platform administration
  - Subscription tracking and organization
  - Reminder and notification system
  - Financial tracking and reporting
- **User Experience**:
  - Intuitive interface with consistent design patterns
  - Responsive design for all device types
  - Accessibility features for users with disabilities
- **Data Management**:
  - User settings and preferences
  - CSV import/export for subscriptions
  - Data backup and recovery options
- **Performance**:
  - Optimized API calls and data fetching
  - Efficient state management
  - Fast page load times and transitions

### Out of Scope:
- **Payment Processing**:
  - Direct payment processing or handling
  - Credit card storage or processing
  - Automatic billing functionality
- **External Integrations**:
  - Direct integration with subscription services
  - Automatic subscription cancellation
  - Third-party accounting software integration (for v2)
- **Advanced Features** (for future versions):
  - AI-powered recommendations
  - Subscription negotiation assistance
  - Advanced team collaboration features

### User Types & Roles:
1. **Admin Users (type 1)**:
   - Access to admin dashboard and administrative features
   - User management capabilities
   - System configuration and monitoring
   - Analytics and reporting across all users
2. **Regular Users (type 2)**:
   - Access to user dashboard for managing personal subscriptions
   - Full CRUD operations on their own subscriptions
   - Personal analytics and insights
   - Customizable reminder settings
3. **Team Users (future)**:
   - Collaborative subscription management for teams
   - Shared subscription visibility and management
   - Team-based analytics and reporting
   - Role-based permissions within teams

## üöÄ Current Development Focus & Priorities

### Immediate Focus (Q4 2023)
The current development focus is on implementing performance optimizations throughout the application, particularly eliminating duplicate API calls and optimizing client-side operations. This will provide a more responsive user experience by reducing network traffic and improving page load times. The patterns established in the subscription listing page, including request deduplication and client-side caching, will be extended to other parts of the application to ensure consistent performance improvements across the platform.

### Key Priorities:
1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement direct store access pattern across all components
   - Eliminate duplicate API calls through request deduplication
   - Optimize client-side operations for filtering, sorting, and pagination
   - Improve loading states and error handling

2. **Architecture Standardization**:
   - Standardize on Zustand for state management
   - Implement consistent form handling with React Hook Form
   - Establish consistent component organization patterns
   - Document architectural patterns for team reference

3. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Enhance subscription management interface
   - Improve mobile responsiveness
   - Standardize UI components and patterns
   - Optimize form layouts and validation

### Success Metrics:
- 50%+ reduction in API calls for common user journeys
- Sub-500ms response time for all critical API endpoints
- Under 2-second initial page load time
- Improved user satisfaction ratings
