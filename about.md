# SubsHero Product Context

## üöÄ Why SubsHero Exists
SubsHero was created to solve the growing problem of subscription management in today's digital economy. As consumers subscribe to more digital services, keeping track of renewal dates, costs, and managing overall subscription spending becomes increasingly difficult. SubsHero provides a centralized platform where users can track all their subscriptions, receive timely reminders, and gain insights into their subscription spending patterns.

## üéØ Vision Statement
To be the leading subscription management platform that empowers users to take control of their digital spending, never miss a renewal, and optimize their subscription budget through actionable insights and timely notifications.

## üîç Problems Solved
1. **Subscription Overload**: Users often lose track of how many subscriptions they have active
2. **Unexpected Renewals**: Automatic renewals can lead to unexpected charges
3. **Budget Management**: Difficulty in tracking total subscription spending
4. **Organization**: Lack of a centralized system to manage different types of subscriptions
5. **Renewal Tracking**: Missing important renewal dates or free trial expirations
6. **Spending Visibility**: Limited visibility into subscription spending patterns over time
7. **Lifetime Deal Management**: Difficulty tracking one-time "lifetime" subscription purchases

## üõ†Ô∏è How SubsHero Works
SubsHero is a web application that allows users to:
1. **Add Subscriptions**: Manually add subscription details or import them via CSV
2. **Organize**: Group subscriptions into folders and categories for better organization
3. **Set Reminders**: Create reminder profiles to receive notifications before renewals
4. **Track Finances**: Record transactions and view spending analytics through intuitive dashboards
5. **Manage Payment Methods**: Keep track of which payment method is used for each subscription
6. **Monitor Renewals**: Get a clear view of upcoming renewal dates and payment amounts
7. **Track Lifetime Deals**: Special handling for one-time "lifetime" subscription purchases

The application does not directly integrate with subscription services or process payments. Instead, it serves as a tracking and notification system that helps users manage their subscriptions manually with a focus on performance and user experience.

## üîç Current Product Focus
The current product focus is on improving the application's performance by eliminating duplicate API calls and optimizing client-side operations. This will enhance the user experience by:
1. **Reducing Loading Times**: Eliminating duplicate API calls for subscription data (target: 50%+ reduction)
